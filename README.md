*****IRIS DATASET ANALYSIS*****


The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.


The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.


Each of these Flowers have 4 features.
Petal Length
Petal Width
Sepal Length
Sepal Width


The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns. The four attributes describe the shape and size of the flower.
For the analysis part i am using the packages of python packages such as 


NUMPY:
        Numpy is used for handling array objects and lists. I have used numpy for specifying the columns

PANDAS:
        Pandas is used for loading the CSV file from various websites. I have created a dataframe using pandas. Pandas is very helpful in data cleaning and processing. Adding new columns in the dataframe was easy with the help of pandas. 

MATPLOTLIB:
        Throughout the data analysis I took the help of matplotlib package provided by python. I have used matplotlib for creating histograms,boxplots,and scatter plots 

SEABORN:
        I have used seaborn for creating density plots. The grids in the plots are of seaborn style.
